                <p>A Firebase and Supabase alternative that uses decentralised technologies to preserve the same
                    developer friendly experience, but with the added power and flexibility of Web 3.0.</p>
                <p>Compared to AWS ($0.025 per GB), storing files on P2P networks like IPFS is dirt cheap ($ 0.000005
                    /GB/Year) as well as tolerant to failure of one or more nodes. Only if every node in the world stops
                    working will the network be offline</p>
                <p>We have 3 main products:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Pay is our Polygon-based payments service. We leverage the security of modern cryptography to
                        implement a secure and easy way for developers to collect payments in cryptocurrencies from
                        their users.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Buckets is our Crust-based object storage solution, which stores files in 'buckets' (containers
                        for objects).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Every blanket app comes pre-provisioned with a decentralized IPFS based database solution in the
                        form of OrbitDB. Orbit provides many different services for cloud data storage. Because it is
                        backed by IPFS, it ensures that the data is censorship resistant and highly redundant.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>
